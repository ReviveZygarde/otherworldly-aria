# otherworldly-aria
A text adventure game written in Twine
“Otherworldly Aria” is a continuation, more like an indirect sequel, to my previous Text Adventure game that I made around a year ago, this time was written in Twine instead of a CLI-based C# application. The purpose of the project is to allow an experience where the player can start a series of text-adventure games with different installments instead of starting the series with the first game. Using Twine, it allowed much more interactivity such as easier-to-implement timers, typing, easier boolean functions, and passage-based content that allow the game to jump to all sorts of different places without having to make spaghetti code. I tried to create an experience where the player can feel immersed, like physically typing on keyboards, as well as making the interface experience much better such as legible fonts and point-click menus compared to the first text adventure game I made.
